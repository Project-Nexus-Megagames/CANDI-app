## Setup

Greetings human/robot/other! You have made the unfortunate decision to help with the CANDI app! Here's how to se up:

1) Once you have cloned the repository, move into the folder candi-app with the terminal (cd candi-app)
2) Enter the command npm i to install dependencies. Don't worry about any warnings about vulnerabilites, I am sure thosewill never be relevent or a problem!
3) Repeat the process with the CANDI-server in a different window of your code editor
4) In the folder config on server, copy the env.example and rename it to .env
4) Get all the secrets you need for the .env file 
4) boot up the server with the command npm run server
5) boot up the app with npm start
6) start programming!
